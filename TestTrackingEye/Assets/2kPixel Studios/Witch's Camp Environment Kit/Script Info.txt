This file gives a brief overview of what each C# script does.
If you have any questions about what was written, you can contact
us at our support email, developers@2kpixelstudios.net.

FirstPersonCamera:
	Enables you to control a camera using basic input from the keyboard and mouse.
	It needs to have a CharacterController on the same GameObject, and should have
	a Camera as a child object underneath it.

FlowingCloth:
	Allows you to animate the external forces on a cloth component to change over time,
	simulating the effect of wind.

GameManager:
	Keeps itself and the other manager singleton from being destroyed when new scenes load.

GraphicFader:
	Fades out a graphic after a given initial delay time in seconds.

PathwayCamera:
	Given a Transform parent, this component follows the path formed by the children of
	that Transform (in the order they are shown in the hierarchy), and attempts to
	slightly curve the path for a smoother effect.

SceneDoor:
	Manages the state of the doors on the inside and outside of the witch's house.
	Once the FirstPersonCamera enters its trigger, then this causes a scene change
	and opens the door with an animation.

SimpleWater:
	When this component is attached to a Renderer with a Material using the Simple Water
	shader, this script changes some of the properties of the water Material to make
	the water appear to be moving slightly on the surface.

UIManager:
	Manages general UI for the demo scenes, including keeping the screen canvas
	from destroying when the scene changes, and creating an easier interface into fading
	in and out the screen fader.
